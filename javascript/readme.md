This script is designed to automatically apply for jobs based on a prefiltered link. 
An example link would be: https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/computer-science-jobs-united-states/?f_AL=true&f_E=2&f_WT=2&geoId=103644278

***Easy Apply must be on***

The script does automation based on prefilled answers from previous easy apply, so having used easy apply a lot will make this script run smoothly.
If you haven't filled out a pre-questionaire on easy apply it will simply stop the script giving and alert "You need to enter info." Using the main(); 
method after filling out the empty space will continue the script.

Isn't fullproof will have connection errors must have a good connection to have the script run well. Also haven't incorporated the next page after applying for all the jobs on the current page.
